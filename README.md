VeriLingua
==========

VeriLingua is a translation quality checker that evaluates the quality of human translations by comparing them against machine-generated translations. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP), VeriLingua produces similarity scores that help gauge the accuracy and consistency of translations. This tool is designed to provide translators and reviewers with an objective metric for translation quality, enabling more consistent and reliable evaluations.

Project Overview
----------------

VeriLingua compares a human translation (B) of a source text (A) with machine-generated translations to create a quality score. The process includes:
1. Generating a machine translation of A (A') into the target language.
2. Generating a back-translation of B (B') into the source language.
3. Comparing A with B' and B with A' using NLP tools to determine similarity scores.

If both comparisons show high similarity, the translation quality is considered high. VeriLingua combines these scores to provide an overall quality metric for each translation, allowing users to assess quality at a glance.

Key Features
------------

- **Translation Quality Scoring**: Uses NLP-based metrics to compare the semantic and structural similarity between source and target translations.
- **Flexible Comparison Methods**: Allows multiple comparison options, including BLEU, METEOR, and BERTScore, for in-depth analysis.
- **Automatic Machine Translation**: Integrates with machine translation APIs to generate benchmarks for quality assessment.
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Enables custom thresholds for similarity scores, allowing for tailored quality evaluations.

Suggested Comparison Methods
----------------------------

VeriLingua supports several popular NLP comparison methods for evaluating translations. These are suggestions, and contributors may choose to add or experiment with other options:

1. **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**: Measures precision by comparing n-grams between source and back-translated text.
2. **METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering)**: Analyzes precision, recall, synonymy, and stemming in translations.
3. **BERTScore**: Uses BERT embeddings to calculate the semantic similarity of text pairs.
4. **Word Mover's Distance (WMD)**: Measures semantic similarity by calculating the minimum distance between word embeddings.

Development Environment
-----------------------

- **Languages/Frameworks**: VeriLingua can be implemented using Python for its robust NLP libraries, such as NLTK, spaCy, and Hugging Face’s Transformers.
- **Git-Based Workflow**: Please follow a Git-based workflow, with all contributions submitted via pull requests. Each PR will be reviewed against specific acceptance criteria.
